# Sample of Prerequisite Calculations for Linear Regression Modeling

This shows a sample of the prerequisite calculations required for determining if a linear regression model is appropriate for analyzing a data set.
The resulting model is used to analyze tree age (response) based on tree diameter (predictor).

## Getting Started

Data.csv contains two columns:
* DiameterInches: the diameter of sample trees in inches
* AgeYears: the age of sample trees in years
    
Execute all lines in R Studio

### Prerequisites

None

### Installing

None

### Running

1. Create a new project in R Studio
2. Add the files in this repo to the project, or clone this repo
3. Run all lines
